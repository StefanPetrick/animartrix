25.03.  enabled oscillator offsets by setting timings.offset[i]
        (can be used to shift the timebase for otherwise identical oscillators)
        global speed and speed ratios are now accessed by timings.master_speed & timings.ratio[i]  
        started documentation.txt
        introduced animation_collection.ino

24.03.  report_performance() shows now rendering time and data transmission time per frame
        fps counting independent from FastLED now

23.03.  rewrote most code using structs
        reorganized oscillators: introduced move.linear[i], move.radial[i], move.directional[i], move.noise_angle[i],
