29.03.  -testing the FastNoiseLite library https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite
        -lens: distance * distamce and scale/zoom in

28.03.  -cleanup, bugfixes, Yves() & Spiralus() animations, documentation

27.03.  -enabled multiple animations at the same time and temporal dithering for blending them together with outstanding quality
        -the visual appearence is unreal considering it still runs on 8 bit LEDs 
         (3 animations, each 4 layers running together at >400fps on a Teensy 3.6)
        -be aware: it looks satin-smooth to the human eye, but can cause a rolling shutter effect on video camera

25.03.  -enabled oscillator offsets by setting timings.offset[i]
         (can be used to shift the timebase for otherwise identical oscillators)
        -global speed and speed ratios are now accessed by timings.master_speed & timings.ratio[i]  
        -started documentation.txt
        -introduced animation_collection.ino

24.03.  -report_performance() shows now rendering time and data transmission time per frame
         fps counting independent from FastLED now

23.03.  -rewrote most code using structs
        -reorganized oscillators: introduced move.linear[i], move.radial[i], move.directional[i], move.noise_angle[i],
