# AnimARTrix

by Stefan Petrick. High quality LED animations for your project. 

This is a Shader & 5D Coordinate Mapper made for realtime rendering of generative animations & artistic dynamic visuals.

It enables high framerate FPU rendering and up to 32 bit color depth per RGB chanel for outstanding visual quality and dynamic range.

96 bit color resolution is ready to be used in your next cutting edge art installation or project. 

In case you find my work useful & you'd like to say thank you [I happily welcome your kind donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YR7Q795MYU9HS).

A big thank you to Sutaburosu, Antti Yliniemi & Yves Bazin for the kind support!



## Required Software: 

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

[Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

[FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)




## Recommended Hardware: 

Any fast FPU microcontroller & lots of programmamble LEDs.

For best results use a [Teensy 4](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)

Also better have a beefy power supply for the LEDs - the code has no brightness or current limit in place - better be prepared to supply all LEDs going full white at once.
