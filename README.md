A big thank you to Sutaburosu, Antti Yliniemi & Yves Bazin for the kind support!



## Required Software: 

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

[Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

[FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)




## Recommended Hardware: 

Any fast FPU microcontroller & lots of programmamble LEDs.

For best results use a [Teensy 4](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)

Also better have a beefy power supply for the LEDs - the code has no brightness or current limit in place - better be prepared to supply all LEDs going full white at once.
