# AnimARTrix

by Stefan Petrick 2023. 

High quality LED animations for your project.

This is a Shader and 5D Coordinate Mapper made for realtime rendering of generative animations & artistic dynamic visuals. This is also a modular animation synthesizer with waveform generators, oscillators, filters, modulators, noise generators, compressors... and much more. 

This software enables high framerate FPU rendering and up to 32 bit color depth per RGB chanel for outstanding visual quality and dynamic range.

96 bit color resolution is ready to be used in your next level art installation or visual project. 

In case you find my work useful and you would like to say thank you [I happily welcome your kind donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=YR7Q795MYU9HS).

Would you like to use my code or animations in your commercial product or project? Great, please reach out to me and together we'll find a fair licensing solution we're both happy with!

A big thank you to Sutaburosu, Antti Yliniemi & Yves Bazin for the kind support!



## Required Software: 

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

[Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

[FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)




## Recommended Hardware: 

Any fast FPU microcontroller and lots of programmamble LEDs.

For best results use a [Teensy 4](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)

Use a power supply and wiring that can provide enough Amps for your LED display - the code has no brightness or current limiting in place - and occasionally all LEDs could go full white.
